inkdroid
========

The [inkdroid.org](http://inkdroid.org) stomping ground, such as it is.

To get things fully functioning you need to symlink in the following git
repositories:

* chronam-widget
* empirical-cloud
* jquery-wikipedia
* lcco
* lod-graph
* subjects-here
* wikitrends
* hathitime
* lastcloud

And then setup wordpress in a directory named `journal` hopefully populated
with a backup of the inkdroid wordpress database.
